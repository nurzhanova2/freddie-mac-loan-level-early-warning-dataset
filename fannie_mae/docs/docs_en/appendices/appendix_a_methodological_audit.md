# Appendix A. Methodological audit of data and models

## A.1. Purpose

This appendix records data provenance, transformation rules, outcome
definitions, temporal evaluation boundaries, and model specifications. It is
intended to make the empirical work reproducible and to distinguish documented
procedures from interpretive conclusions.

## A.2. Data source, structure, and glossary

The source is the Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Primary Dataset.
The official [file layout and glossary](../../sources/crt-file-layout-and-glossary.xlsx)
define field names, types, and economic meanings. Raw deliveries contain 113
positions; the analytical panel retains 35 fields needed for outcome derivation
and admissible predictors. The analytical unit is a loan-month observation.

The Q1 development workstream contains 185,931,842 loan-month observations and
3,343,420 loans. The extended Q1+Q3 workstream contains 467,638,404
observations and 8,272,539 loans counted across separate cohort panels; this is
not a globally deduplicated count of loan identifiers across raw archives.

## A.3. Cleaning, preparation, and leakage control

1. Archives are checked for field count, non-empty loan-identifier/reporting-
   month keys, and repeated keys.
2. Blank and whitespace-only values become missing values; `MMYYYY` fields are
   converted to calendar dates; analytical numeric fields are cast to numeric
   types.
3. The cleaned 113-field layer is kept separately from the 35-field analytical
   panel.
4. Variables that can reveal a future outcome, including Zero Balance Code,
   Zero Balance Effective Date, and foreclosure/disposition fields, are
   excluded from predictors. The decisions are recorded in the [leakage register](../../../data/dictionaries/fannie_2008q1_leakage_register_v01.csv).
5. Q3 provenance and structural checks are recorded in the [Q3 audit](../17_q3_archive_audit_execution_report.md).

## A.4. Outcomes, horizon, and censoring

| Outcome | Future-window event | Horizon | Risk set | Censoring |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `formal_adverse_6m` | status 03–98, i.e., 90+ days past due | 6 months | all admissible observations | incomplete future window or unobserved future status |
| `early_deterioration_6m` | transition from current to 01–98, i.e., 30+ days past due | 6 months | loans current at *t* only | same rule |

Codes XX and 99 are not events. Prepayment, maturity, and zero-balance
termination are not labelled as default. The complete procedure is in the
[Stages 7–9 report](../07_09_execution_report.md).

## A.5. Temporal split and actual training samples

The v01 baseline uses January 2006–December 2016 for training, January
2017–December 2020 for validation, and January 2021–September 2025 for the
independent out-of-time test. The last date preserves a complete six-month
outcome window because the delivery ends in March 2026.

The v01 models were not trained with the full record population loaded into
memory. A deterministic hash rule formed a case-control training sample and
1% temporal validation/out-of-time samples at natural event rates:

| Outcome | Train, observations (events) | Validation, observations (events) | OOT, observations (events) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `formal_adverse_6m` | 628,102 (228,320) | 337,541 (3,732) | 658,314 (3,192) |
| `early_deterioration_6m` | 604,627 (205,659) | 332,693 (10,040) | 651,914 (15,242) |

In the extended v02 Q1+Q3 comparison, training samples contain 1,262,399
observations (420,588 events) for `formal_adverse_6m` and 1,240,046
observations (396,152 events) for `early_deterioration_6m`. This is a separate
extension experiment; it does not replace the v01 baseline results.

## A.6. Model parameters, calibration, and trigger policy

| Component | Fixed v01 specification |
|---|---|
| Logistic regression | `solver=saga`, `max_iter=120`, `C=1.0`, `random_state=42` |
| XGBoost | 160 trees, depth 6, `learning_rate=0.08`, `min_child_weight=10`, `subsample=0.8`, `colsample_bytree=0.8`, `tree_method=hist`, `random_state=42` |
| Calibration | isotonic regression fitted only on validation; OOT is not used to fit the calibrator |
| Red alert | `formal_adverse_6m`, top-1% review capacity; OOT precision 24.29%, recall 50.09% |
| Amber alert | `early_deterioration_6m`, top-5% review capacity; OOT precision 8.69%, recall 18.59% |

The [versioned policy](../../../config/fannie_suptech_trigger_policy_v01.yml)
explicitly prohibits autonomous supervisory or enforcement action. An alert
only prioritises human review and is accompanied by a local explanation.
