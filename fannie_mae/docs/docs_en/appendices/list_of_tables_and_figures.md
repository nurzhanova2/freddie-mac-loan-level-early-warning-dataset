# List of tables and figures

This register is the single numbering reference for the dissertation's main
version. Numbers, captions, and in-text references must match these entries.
Links point to reproducible project artefacts.

## In-text reference rule

Use “see Figure 3.4” or “results are reported in Table 6.1.” Figure captions
appear below figures and table captions above tables. Captions state the
substantive title rather than the file name; the source should be given as
“author’s calculations using Fannie Mae data,” with the artefact version noted
in an appendix or footnote.
