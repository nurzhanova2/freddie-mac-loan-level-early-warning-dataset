**“Explainable artificial intelligence for early detection of credit risk and
hidden deterioration in borrower quality.”**

## Abstract

This study examines whether loan-level information available at a reporting
month can identify subsequent deterioration in mortgage credit quality before a
formal adverse event is observed. The empirical analysis uses the Fannie Mae
Single-Family Loan Performance Primary Dataset and treats a loan-month as the
unit of analysis. Model development, calibration, and final assessment are
separated chronologically, so that predictions are evaluated on later,
previously unseen periods and future information is excluded from the features.

Two six-month outcomes are examined: formal adverse status, defined by a future
90+ days-past-due status, and early deterioration, defined as a transition from
a current status to 30+ days past due. Logistic regression provides an
interpretable benchmark and XGBoost a nonlinear comparison. Alongside
discrimination metrics, the study evaluates probability calibration,
capacity-constrained alert thresholds, and lead time. TreeSHAP describes the
model's reliance on observed variables and is not interpreted causally.

Within the selected Fannie Mae cohorts, XGBoost achieves higher out-of-time
discrimination than the logistic benchmark. The resulting analytical prototype
produces a risk estimate, an explanation of the prediction, and an alert tier
to prioritise expert review; it is not an autonomous credit or supervisory
decision system.
